# Highview Scaffolding – Website audit (practical)

## What the existing site does well
- Clear message that you cover domestic + commercial scaffolding and the main service area.
- Trust signals are present (CHAS Advanced, DBS checked).
- You have social presence and real project imagery.

## What holds it back
- The page reads like a brochure rather than a conversion tool.
- The "why choose us" benefits aren’t stated strongly enough.
- Calls-to-action could be more dominant (call / quote).
- Imagery exists but isn’t used to create a premium first impression.

## What the new site improves
- Strong hero (benefit-led) + immediate call/quote CTAs.
- Premium design + modern performance.
- Moving Google-style reviews strip (pauses on hover).
- Gallery designed to build trust quickly.
- SEO foundation included (metadata + sitemap + robots).
